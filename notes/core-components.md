# Core Comonents of the OS

## The Filesystem Structure

Everything starts from the root "/"

### Conventions

Some conventions get violated, but typically:

- `/bin` executable binaries.
- `/home` user files are kept here
- `/usr/bin` user space binaries
- `/var` Variable length data, like logs. Anything that varies in size
- `/etc` configuration data
