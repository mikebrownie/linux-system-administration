*Subject: Request for full administrative access*
____
My beloved Jim,

While allowing you full administrative access may make our lives easier, I can't grant this priviledge as it poses a threat to the security of our network. I do appreciate you stepping up and offering help in "the event you out of town I might need to access employee files or help them out with other things." As a matter of fact, I would love to teach you more about my job and the considerations that go into being a linux system administrator. If you are up for it, we can meet with Michael Scott tomorrow afternoon and discuss the possibility of a weekly training session! 

In the meantime, please avoid sending your password to anyone! You should not store your passwords in plaintext anywhere. Imagine if I did grant your request for super user privilidge, and someone with your password used it to delete our servers or steal our sales leads. Michael Scott would not be happy! 

Sincerely,

Brown, M.

System Administrator.
