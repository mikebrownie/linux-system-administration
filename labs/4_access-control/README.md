    Subject: Request for full administrative access
____
My beloved Jim,


While allowing you full administrative access may make our lives easier, I can't grant this priviledge as it poses a threat to the security of our network. I do appreciate you stepping up and offering help in "the event you out of town I might need to access employee files or help them out with other things." As a matter of fact, I would love to teach you more about my job and the considerations that go into being a linux system administrator. If you are up for it, we can meet with Michael Scott tomorrow afternoon and discuss the possibility of a weekly training session! 

In the meantime, please avoid sending your password to anyone! You should not store your passwords in plaintext anywhere. Imagine if I did grant your request for super user privilidge, and someone with your password used it to steal our sales leads, or worse, delete our servers! Michael Scott would not be happy.


Sincerely,

Brown, M.

System Administrator.

I can log in to my account on our ftp server, but I can no longer restart vsftp as I used to using the systemctl restart vsftpd thingy or modify any files under /var/ftp/.  I have supplier lists I need to update today.  Please fix it now!!!!

I just wanted to let you know that neither Kelly Kapoor, Andy Bernard, nor I can update the website anymore.  We have some changes to make soon so it would be wonderful if we could be granted access to modify the files on our web server under /var/www/dundermifflin/ and restart httpd like we used to!  Thank you very much for your help!

Your clever attempt to gain control of our Linux systems has worked, but only temporarily.  Michael Scott will confirm that I must be granted administrative access on all servers.  Please grant me access today, or else.


### Jim Halpert
From: Jim Halpert

Hey, quick questionâ€¦ can you grant me full administrative access on all of the servers?  In the event that you are out of town I might need to access employee files or help them out with other things.  My password is Dund3rMifflin if that makes it easier for you.
